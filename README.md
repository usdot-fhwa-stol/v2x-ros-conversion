# v2x-ros-conversion

The V2X-ROS-Conversion package contains two ROS nodes: Message node and J2735 Convertor Node, both work in tandem to convert a ROS message to a J2735 message with SI units. 

## Architecture

 The Message node takes in a ROS message and uses asn1c lib generated code to convert it to a binary blob and forwards it to the DSRC driver, such that any OBU/RSU can broadcast the message directly. The J2735 Converter converts the data from a ROS message based on the J2735 standard units to another message using more usable SI units and vice-versa.
