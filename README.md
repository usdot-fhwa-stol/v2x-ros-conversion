# v2x-ros-conversion
The V2X-ROS-Conversion package contains two ROS nodes that converts a ROS message to a binary message that can be forwarded to a OBU/RSU to broadcast the message. This package uses ROS2 Humble.

## Architecture

The core components in the v2x-ros-conversion package contains two ROS nodes: cpp_message node and J2735 Convertor Node. The cpp_message node takes in a ROS message and uses asn1c lib generated code to convert it to a binary blob and forwards it to the DSRC driver, such that any OBU/RSU can broadcast the message directly. The J2735 Converter converts the data from a ROS message based on the J2735 standard units to another message using more usable SI units and vice-versa.

### Example Setup

```
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/v2x-ros-conversion.git

# Build development config
cd v2x-ros-conversion/docker
./build-image.sh
```

To incorporate the v2x-ros-conversion package into a docker project, call the following command to clone the v2x-ros-conversion package into the project:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/v2x-ros-conversion.git ${dir}/src/v2x-ros-conversion --branch "develop"
```
Once installed, the required dependencies for the v2x-ros-conversion package need to be installed prior to building the package. To do so, run 
```
sudo ~/src/v2x-ros-conversion/docker/install_dependencies.sh
```

Once the dependencies are installed, build the image as shown above.

### Build From Source
Ensure that a version of Ubuntu 22 is installed with the foxy version of carma-base. Once installed, follow the following steps in install the v2x-ros-conversion package into the project.
1. Clone the repository into the workspace
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/v2x-ros-conversion.git ${dir}/src/v2x-ros-conversion --branch "develop-foxy"
```
2. Clone the v2x-ros-conversion package dependencies into the workspace
```
sudo ~/src/docker/checkout.bash
```
3. Install the v2x-ros-conversion package
```
sudo ~/src/docker/install.sh
```
